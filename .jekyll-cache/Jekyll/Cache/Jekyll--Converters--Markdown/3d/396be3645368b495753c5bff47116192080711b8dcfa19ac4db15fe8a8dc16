<h3 id="c">C++</h3>

<p>I studied C++ to play in <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode.com</a>. I’ve searched for how to be a nice programmer, and programming skill for algorithm seems like essential. I like solving mathematical problems, but I’m not sure that I would like solving algorithm problems in leetcode. I think… it will be a great challenge to me.</p>

<h3 id="git">Git</h3>

<p>I tried to post about Git today, but I failed. Egoing, the lecturer of Opentutorials, said in introduction of Git lecture, “Before learning Git, there’s something you need to know”, “Git is incredibly complex.” And I think that’s true. Before I post about Git on my blog, I think I have to learn more about it.</p>
