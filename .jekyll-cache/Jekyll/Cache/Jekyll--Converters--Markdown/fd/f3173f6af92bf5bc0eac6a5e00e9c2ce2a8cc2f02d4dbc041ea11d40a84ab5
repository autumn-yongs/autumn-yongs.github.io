<p>You can work on a project without remote repository unless you were on the group. If not, you‚Äôll need it. Group members have to share files through somewhere shared place. For that, remote repository, pushing, pulling, branching, and some functions of Git are required.</p>

<h3 id="setting-a-remote-repository-for-your-project">Setting a remote repository for your project</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git remote -v</code>
    <ul>
      <li>View your remote repositories. If you command it for the first time after you created the project with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git init</code>, there would be nothing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git remote add [name] [URL]</code>
    <ul>
      <li>Add information of remote repository in Git‚Äôs configuration file. If you don‚Äôt mind, just write [name] as ‚Äòorigin‚Äô. The reason is on below.</li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Naming remote repository as ‚Äòorigin‚Äô is general, because console uses ‚Äòorigin‚Äô as default remote repository when you omit it in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">push</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull</code> commands.</p>

          <p>If you don‚Äôt know about those commands, never mind. I will tell you about that on the next part of this article. Skip this, and come back here later.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git remote add origin [your Github repository URL]</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git remote -v</code>
    <ul>
      <li>Type this command again. Now you can see your remote repository is added.</li>
      <li>You can also check it in git‚Äôs configuration file. Command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git config --list</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-branch">What is ‚Äòbranch‚Äô?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Before using remote repository, you have to know about branch. I won‚Äôt explain it in detail cause its content is super massive in itself. In this post, therefore, I‚Äôll make it as simple as possible. Let‚Äôs talk about it later in detail. Let‚Äôs get started!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Git stores project‚Äôs status and history as a series of snapshots. We call each snapshot as ‚Äòcommit‚Äô.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git commit</code>, Git takes a snapshot and stores them as a tree object in the Git repository. In other words, Git makes an object(commit) and link it to other object which is made before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can run your project on just one track by linking new object to one of the most recent one, but you also can manage project on two or more tracks by ramifying new object from specific track, <strong>which is branching</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One project can be managed with many branches, and the default branch among those is called <strong>master</strong> branch.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="put-your-project-on-and-get-project-from-remote-repository">Put your project on and Get project from remote repository</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git push origin master</code>
    <ul>
      <li>Literally, this command says, ‚ÄúHey, Git. Push <strong>master</strong> branch‚Äôs history to remote repository which is <strong>origin</strong>.</li>
      <li>On your first try, this put your local project on remote repository. And on tries after that, this updates your remote repository whenever you type.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git pull origin</code>
    <ul>
      <li>This causes exactly the reverse case against the former. This updates your local repository with remote one, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">push</code> updates remote one with local one.</li>
      <li>Explaining what exactly happens in tree in the Git repository when you call this would confuse you. For now, never mind. I‚Äôll explain it below. This command would not make errors unless you work in group.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git fetch origin</code>
    <ul>
      <li>This gets data from origin, remote repository. But this does not update your local repository. That is what you have to do.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-happens-in-my-local-git-repository">What happens in my local Git repository?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I told you that the local Git repository stores snapshots as a tree object. And the tracks consist of particular snapshots are called branches.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> make new branch when they are called.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="work-in-group-using-remote-repository">Work in group using remote repository</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You don‚Äôt have to worry about integrity of remote repository if you work alone. But there would be some problems when you work in group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose that you are working in specific branch(in this example, <strong>origin</strong>) with your group members. You updated your local repository by commanding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git pull origin</code> to modify some codes.</p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
