<h3 id="jekyll-structure">Jekyll structure</h3>

<p>I was extremely confused about Jekyll. I tried to build my blog by myself, but there were many problems. I wander around my Jekyll blog after I had completely followed the tutorial of official website. So, I read the documents yesterday, repeatedly and intensively. Finally, I could get close to Jekyll blog as I understood the skeleton of Jekyll system.</p>

<h3 id="git">Git</h3>

<p>I feel keenly the necessity of Git while I run my blog. Today I learned about Git’s branching system. However, as I’ve never experienced group project, some concepts of Git’s branch are confusing. I think I have to study more about that.</p>

<h3 id="markdown">Markdown</h3>

<p>I was confused about markdown template. I followed the guide, but the theme was so unattractive. My blog becomes fancy after I realized that I had to apply some plugins for text-highlighting. I installed ‘rouge’ in gem, and I applied that onto my blog. During the posting of <a href="/jekyll/2020/09/26/Jekyll.html">[Jekyll] How to use Markdown</a>, I’ve completed a custom theme. ^_^</p>

<h3 id="blog-decoration">Blog decoration</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added profile box on navigation bar.</li>
  <li>Applied syntax highlighting theme on posts.</li>
  <li>Decorated posts’ css style.</li>
</ul>
