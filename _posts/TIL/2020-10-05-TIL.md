## Today I Learned

### Learning is...

* It's hard to find time for posting while I have a lot of contents to post. Whenever I write an article, I feel that explaining something in my brain to other people is very hard. But, that makes me punctual in checking the concept.

* If I did not run my blog, I would have just searched on google that how to control the floating point when I print output value to console. Running my blog, however, made me a detailed person. I refered to C++ documents and many other blogs. Even, it made me dig into the inside details of the structure of header file.

* Sometimes, posting seems like time-consuming; it takes a lot of time. But, I can learn and understand clearly about things by that. Finally, it becomes time-saving.

* I firmly believe that practicing hard will give me a prize in algorithm contest.
