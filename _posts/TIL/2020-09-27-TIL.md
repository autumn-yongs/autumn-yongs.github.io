## Today I Learned

### C++

I studied C++ to play in [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/). I've searched for how to be a nice programmer, and programming skill for algorithm seems like essential. I like solving mathematical problems, but I'm not sure that I would like solving algorithm problems in leetcode. I think... it will be a great challenge to me.

### Git

I tried to post about Git today, but I failed. Egoing, the lecturer of Opentutorials, said in introduction of Git lecture, "Before learning Git, there's something you need to know", "Git is incredibly complex." And I think that's true. Before I post about Git on my blog, I think I have to learn more about it.

## Today I Posted

* I shared my experience on customizing Rouge theme and scrollbar.
  - [[Jekyll] Syntax highlighting with Rouge]({% post_url /Jekyll/2020-09-27-Jekyll-1 %})
  - [[Jekyll] Colorize text using Markdown]({% post_url /Jekyll/2020-09-27-Jekyll-2 %})
  - [[CSS] Customize scrollbar on your web browser]({% post_url /HTML_CSS_JS/2020-09-27-HTML_CSS_JS %})
