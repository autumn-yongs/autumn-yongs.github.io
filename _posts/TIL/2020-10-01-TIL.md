## Today I Learned

### C++

* I've ever experienced **C** language before which is very old programming language alongside **C++**.

* C++ wanted to be an object oriented language by succeeding to C rather than becoming an entirely new language.

* On that account, there's some confusing and complex concepts on C++.

* I tried to resolve that problem by posting on my blog. And I think it has helped me a lot.

### Disqus

* I need some places to store comments in order to make comment system in my blog by myself.

* But that's impossible on account of github page which is for a static website.

* That is why I have no choice but to use Disqus.

* But, someday, I will make comment system myself.
  - I don't know how to control the user system(I don't want quests to spoil my blog), but I just want to know the techniques.
  
### Leetcode -> Baekjoon Online Judge(BOJ)

* I'm comparative newcomer to algorithm world. I cannot afford to pay for subscribe.

## Today I Posted

* [[C++] The fundamental syntax of C++]({% post_url /Cpp/2020-10-01-Cpp-1 %})
* [[C++] Pass-By-Value and Pass-By-Reference]({% post_url /Cpp/2020-10-01-Cpp-2 %})

## Tomorrow I'll learn
* Studying C++ STL libraries(Vector, Stack, unordered_map) and algorithm techniques(brute-force, hash table).
* Solving the problems on BOJ.
* Studing Git's branch system
