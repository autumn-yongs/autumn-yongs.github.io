## Today I Learned

### C++

* There's a lot of containers and functions in C++ Standard Template Library. And I studied the Vector container first, because it looked like the most important container in STL.

* Of course other containers would be as important as vector. But, I'm going to learn from what I need now.

* Someday, I will conquer the C++ STL by studying step by step.

### Creative Commons License(CCL)

* I learned about Copyright and Creative Commons license which is widely spreaded among the netizen.

* Furthermore, I made my blog introduction card with the copyright of my posts and the comment policy which I want guests to follow. And I put that on the last part of each post.

## Tomorrow I'll learn
