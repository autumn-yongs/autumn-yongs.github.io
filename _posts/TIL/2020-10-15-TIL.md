## Today I Learned

### Sorting Algorithms

* I posted about Sorting Algorithms. I've learned it in university lecture, but I've never organized the concept of it before. As summarizing five well-known sorting algorithms(Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort), I could understand how the algorithms operates and catch out the difference among those algorithms.

### A small change in category page.

* I put a small animation. Whenever I put some small decorations on my blog, an attachment for my blog is being formed.

## Today I Posted

* [[Algorithm] Sorting Algorithms]({% post_url /Algorithm/2020-10-15-Algorithm %})
