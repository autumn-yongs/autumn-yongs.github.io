## Today I Learned

### Algorithm

* I've been totally mad keen on solving algorithm problems. At the beginning, it was really easy and I was able to solve over ten problems, about twenty, per day. But, as the problem was getting difficult, it became time-consuming and careful consideration was required.

* I've learned data structure and algorithm before, but knowing and being able to use it is entirely different. The concept of sorting and searching was familiar to me; however, solving problems with that concept was too unfamiliar for me to roll my pen.

* And that makes me decide to summarize the concept and post it on my blog. I'll come back here after summarizing the concept of sorting and searching.
  - Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Heap sort, etc...
  - Binary tree, DFS(Depth-First Search), BFS(Breadth-Fisrt Search), Back-tracking, etc...
