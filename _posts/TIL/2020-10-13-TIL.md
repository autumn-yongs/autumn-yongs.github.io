## Today I Learned

### C++ STL

* I posted about stack and set libraries.

* Vector, Deque, Queue, Stack, Set. Each of these has their own advantages and disadvantages. To use STL library efficiently, I think I have to study about each container's advantages and disadvantages.

### Templatization

* I made table of contents in html a few days ago, but I felt that it's such a troublesome part in markdown document.

* I didn't want raw HTML to exist in markdown, so I decided to make a new template for table.

* Using **include** system in Jekyll, I made it finally!! Now, it becomes possible to edit the template at once.
