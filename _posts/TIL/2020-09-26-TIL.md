## Today I Learned

### Jekyll structure

I was extremely confused about Jekyll. I tried to build my blog by myself, but there were many problems. I wander around my Jekyll blog after I had completely followed the tutorial of official website. So, I read the documents yesterday, repeatedly and intensively. Finally, I could get close to Jekyll blog as I understood the skeleton of Jekyll system.

### Git

I feel keenly the necessity of Git while I run my blog. Today I learned about Git's branching system. However, as I've never experienced group project, some concepts of Git's branch are confusing. I think I have to study more about that.

### Markdown

I was confused about markdown template. I followed the guide, but the theme was so unattractive. My blog becomes fancy after I realized that I had to apply some plugins for text-highlighting. I installed 'rouge' in gem, and I applied that onto my blog. During the posting of [[Jekyll] How to use Markdown]({% post_url /Jekyll/2020-09-26-Jekyll %}), I've completed a custom theme. ^_^

### Blog decoration

* Added profile box on navigation bar.
* Applied syntax highlighting theme on posts.
* Decorated posts' css style.
