## Today I Learned

### C++ STL

* I usually refer to **cplusplus.com** to study c++ programming. Today I arranged the concept of queue and deque container. It's member functions are very similar to vector's. Even though the exact name of functions are different but the general concept of library and operations are roughly similar.

* Tomorrow, I'm goning to learn about stack, set, and pair containers. I skimmed through the containers, and it seems like no different to containers that I learned already.

### CSS Animation

* I thought that my blog needed some templates for the table of contents. I wanted to toggle table whenever I toggle the switch, and tried to apply some animations.

* Of course I could do javascript, but I wanted to make it only with CSS(SCSS). There's a lot of brilliant free codes for CSS animation, which are shared by talented front-end designers. I analyzed code and tried to make my template by myself.

* Because of this experience, I could learn the transition attribute of CSS and the input and label tag of HTML. I want to share by experience on my blog as soon as possible.
