## Today I Learned

### C++

* It didn't mean to post about file input/output system. I just wanted to post about `cin.eof()`. But I had to study deeply about that for posting, which leads me to write about the file stream library, `<fstream>`.

* Now, I'm happy to understand the concept of stream and buffer.

### Algorithm

* English is not my mother tongue. I'm Korean-born. I studied mathematics in Korean, and I don't know well about mathematic terminologies. But I have to overcome that to have an interview in English in job-seeking, as my dream is having a job in SF.

* It's very simple algorithm, but very hard to explain in English... When can I familiar to mathematic terminology.

## Today I Posted

* [[BOJ] SUGAR - 2839]({% post_url /Algorithm/2020-10-06-Algorithm-1 %})
* [[BOJ] SNAIL - 2869]({% post_url /Algorithm/2020-10-06-Algorithm-2 %})
* [[C++] Interacting with text file by using file input/output stream library]({% post_url /Cpp/2020-10-06-Cpp %})

## Tomorrow I'll learn
* Solving the problems on BOJ.
* Posting about 'text-arrangement in CSS' or 'memory and time-saving in C++'.
