title: "[Jekyll] Syntax highlighting with Rouge"
categories: [ Jekyll ]
---

## Preface
Whenever I was googling for information, codes highlighted as fancy editor attracted me. When I started my blog few days ago, however, there were nothing else than monotonous texts. I wanted to make my code sexier, and **rouge** made it possible.

If you are planning to run a Jekyll blog, or already Jekyll user, using Rouge as syntax highlighter is highly recommended. Rouge as default highlighter in Jekyll 3 and above is specified in official Jekyll website.

> ### Code snippet highlighting
> Jekyll has built in support for syntax highlighting of over 100 languages thanks to Rouge. Rouge is the default highlighter in Jekyll 3 and above.

## How to apply Rouge on your website

### 1. Install Rouge

* Let's start with the assumption that your computer is alrealy equipped with **Ruby** and **Gem** environment.

* `$ gem install rouge`
  - Install Rouge on your computer.

### 2. Select Style

* `$ rougify help style`
  - View available themes in Rouge.

```bash
$ rougify version
3.23.0
$ rougify help style
usage: rougify style [<theme-name>] [<options>]

Print CSS styles for the given theme.  Extra options are
passed to the theme. To select a mode (light/dark) for the
theme, append '.light' or '.dark' to the <theme-name>
respectively. Theme defaults to thankful_eyes.

options:
  --scope       (default: .highlight) a css selector to scope by
  --tex         (default: false) render as TeX
  --tex-prefix  (default: RG) a command prefix for TeX
                implies --tex if specified

available themes:
  base16, base16.dark, base16.light, base16.monokai, base16.monokai.dark, base16.monokai.light, base16.sol
arized, base16.solarized.dark, base16.solarized.light, bw, colorful, github, gruvbox, gruvbox.dark, gruvbo
x.light, igorpro, magritte, molokai, monokai, monokai.sublime, pastie, thankful_eyes, tulip
```

* My Rouge version is 3.23.0, and there are many available themes as you can see in the last part.

* In my case, I chose `monokai.sublime` as syntax highlighter.

* You can preview those themes with sample code: [Here!](https://spsarolkar.github.io/rouge-theme-preview/)

### 3. Download Theme

* `$ rougify style [theme] > [path]`
  - In order to download directly in my Jekyll blog's assets directory, I commanded like this:
    + `$ rougify style monokai.sublime > assets/css/syntax-highlighter.css`
  - You can name css file in your own way.
    + `assets/css/highlighter.css`
  
### 4. Link Stylesheet with HTML

* I didn't have to worry about linking as there was a css link system in my Jekyll blog.

* But if you want to apply stylesheet, which you just downloaded, on your website, you have to link it in appropriate way for your site.
  - For example, add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path]">` in your HTML file.

## How to use

### Markdown

~~~text
```css
.container {
	display: block;
	width: 100%;
	background-color: cornflowerblue;
}
```
```javascript
export function (pieces) {
	const price = 10;
	let total = price * pieces;
	console.log("Total price is: " + total);
	return total;
}

* Jekyll supports converting markdown to HTML code. It is way-way easy to apply with markdown template.

* If you don't know about markdown grammar, I recommend you to google. If you don't mind, there's also my post! ^_^

## Customizing

### 1. Customize Syntax Highlighter

```css
.highlighter-rouge {
	margin: 10px 0;
}

.highlight {
	border-radius: 10px;
	overflow-x: auto;
}

.highlight code {
	font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;
	font-size: small;
}
```

* If you are good at CSS, you can customize figures of highlighter by adding some css codes. It's time to make your code block attractive!

* Parse rendered HTML codes refreshing your website and figuring out what features are applied. Then you could find what elements should be fixed.

* Without trying to customize manually, You might not understand my upper sample customized code.

### 2. Add your own code type
~~~text
```emphasis
I can customize theme.
```
~~~

***

```emphasis
I can customize theme.
```

***

* Try to parse the HTML rendered by markdown converter. It classifies language type from text next to triple backticks.

* The language 'emphasis' is not supported by Rouge. So, I customized it as my theme.
  - In css file, I added this:
```css
.language-emphasis {
	font-family: 'Noto Sans KR', sans-serif;
	color: crimson;
	white-space: normal;
}
```
