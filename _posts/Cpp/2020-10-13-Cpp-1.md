## Preface
I arranged almost the whole of stack container. Of course, there would be more members that the container has. For now, I have organized members that would be useful to me for my future reference. However, most of you would also be content with this post.

## Stack

### What is stack?

* **Stacks** are one of the data structures where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container. And we call that **LIFO(Last-In, First-Out)**

* Imagine *Pringles* which has cylinder shape and the opened base side, while the other is closed. It is exactly in the mould of stack!

### Do you know Vector and Deque?

* The stack container supports the following operations:
  - `empty`
  - `size`
  - `back`
  - `push_back`
  - `pop_back`
  
* Of course the exact member function names are different from them, but operations are same. And the standard container class **vector** and **deque** fulfill these operations. By default, if no container class is specified for a particular queue class instantiation, the standard container deque is used.

* [[C++][STL] Everything about container: Vector]({% post_url /Cpp/2020-10-03-Cpp-2 %})
* [[C++][STL] Everything about container: Deque]({% post_url /Cpp/2020-10-11-Cpp-1 %})

### Before using stack

```cpp
#include < ... >
#include <stack>

#include <vector>
#include <deque>

using namespace std;

int main(){ ... }
```

* `#include <stack>`
  - Include `<stack>` header file to use stack container.
  
* `#include <vector>` / `#include <deque>`
  - As I said before, the instantiation of stack need vector or deque which is the standard container class includes the queue's operations.
  
* `using namespace std;`
  - It's optional, but this makes programming convenient. Without this, you have to add `std::` in front of every single command related to stack.
  
### Constructor

* From now on, let's assume that each example code box contains `#include <stack>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <deque>`, and `using namespace std;`.

```cpp
int main(){
  vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  deque<int> deq = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
  
  stack<int> stackA;
  stack<int> stackB(deq);
  stack<int, vector<int>> stackC;
  stack<int, vector<int>> stackD(vec);
  
  return 0;
}
```

* The basic form of declaration
  - `stack<[Data type]> [Variable name]`

* `stack<int> stackA;`
  - Create empty stack of ints with deque as default underlying container.

* `stack<int> stackB(deq);`
  - Create stack initialized to copy of deque.
  
* `stack<int, vector<int>> stackC;`
  - Create empty stack of ints with vector as underlying container.
  
* `stack<int, vector<int>> stackD(vec);`
  - Create stack initialized to copy of vector.

### Iterators

* There's no iterators in stack container. Iterating the stack is not supported.

* You can realize the iteration of the stack like below example. Note that the print function's parameter is passed by value, not a reference. If you want to print all elements, you have to pop the stack one by one due to the no support for iterators.

### Capacity

```cpp
void print(stack<int> stk){
  cout << "stack contains: ";
  stack<int> temp;
  int s = stk.size();
  for(int i=0; i<s; i++){
    temp.push(stk.top());
    stk.pop();
  }
  for(int i=0; i<s; i++){
    cout << temp.top() << " ";
    temp.pop();
  }
  cout << endl << endl;
}

int main(){
  deque<int> deq {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
  stack<int> stk(deq);
  cout << "Declare stack" << endl;
  print(stk);
  
  stack<int> empty_stk;
  cout << "Declare empty stack" << endl;
  print(empty_stk);
  
  cout << "The size of stack" << endl;
  cout << "stk: " << stk.size() << endl;
  cout << "empty_stk: " << empty_stk.size() << endl << endl;
  
  cout << "Is the stack empty?" << endl;
  cout << "stk: " << stk.empty() << endl;
  cout << "empty_stk: " << empty_stk.empty() << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

---

```text
Declare stack
stack contains: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

Declare empty stack
stack contains: 

The size of stack
stk: 7
empty_stk: 0

Is the stack empty?
stk: 0
empty_stk: 1
```

---

* `size_type size()`
  - Returns the number of elements in the stack.

* `bool empty()`
  - Returns whether the stack is empty.
  
### Element access

```cpp
void print(stack<int> stk){ ... }

int main(){
  deque<int> deq {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
  stack<int> stk(deq);
  
  print(stk);
  cout << "The top(last pushed) element is: " << stk.top() << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

---

```text
stack contains: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

The top(last pushed) element is: 7
```

---

* As there's no function like `stk.at(5)` or operator like `stk[5]`, we can't see inside of the stack container without popping.

* `reference top();`
  - Returns a reference to the top(last pushed) element in the stack.

### Modifiers

### push / pop

```cpp
void print(stack<int> stk){ ... }

int main(){
  deque<int> deq {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
  stack<int> stk(deq);
  
  print(stk);
  cout << "The top(last pushed) element is: " << stk.top() << endl << endl;
  
  stk.push(8);
  
  print(stk);
  cout << "The top(last pushed) element is: " << stk.top() << endl << endl;
  
  stk.pop();
  
  print(stk);
  cout << "The top(last pushed) element is: " << stk.top() << endl << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

---

```text
stack contains: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

The top(last pushed) element is: 7

stack contains: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

The top(last pushed) element is: 8

stack contains: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

The top(last pushed) element is: 7
```

---

* `stk.push(8);`
  - Adds a new element at the top of the stack.
  
* `que.pop();`
  - Removes the top(last pushed) element in the stack.
  - This method **does not return value** while popping the value.
