## Preface
There's a lot of kind experts in the Internet to let you dive into the programming world. As I studied **C++**, I also got help from one of them, **codecademy**. I'm going to arrange briefly the basic syntax of **C++**, which I learned 4 days ago, on this post. As I'm a newbie C++ programmer, the contents might not be accurate and detailed.

## 1. Introduction

### Introduction to C++

* Created by **Bjarne Stroustrup** and his team at Bell Laboratories in 1979.

* Why C++?
  - It is fast and flexible.
  - It is well-supported.
  - It forces you to think in new and creative ways.
  
* C++ is a complied language. It runs line by line, from top to bottom.

* Human-readable code have to be changed to something a machine can understand, which is done by a program called a **compiler**.

### Comments

```cpp
// A single line comment
#include <iostream>

/* A multi-line comment
int print(){
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
}
*/

int main() {
  print();
  return 0;
}
```

* **Comment** will comment out a single line or multiple lines. And the complier will ignore as program runs.

* A single line comment is denoted with two forward slashes `//` preceding it.

* A multi-line comment is denoted with `/*` to begin the comment, and `*/` to end the comment.

### Console input/output

```cpp
// You need this header file, iostream, to read and write with console
#include <iostream>

void main() {
  int number;
  std::cin >> number;
  std::cout << "You've just written: " << number << std::endl;
}
```
```text
5
You've just written: 5
```

* `std::cout` allows us to send data to the console to be printed as text.
  - `cout` stands for "character output"
* `std::cin` allows us to send data to the program through the console.
  - `cin` stands for "character input"
* Double arrows `>>`, `<<` represent the direction of stream.

## 2. Variables

### Basic data types

```cpp
int number = 3;
double score = 4.5;
char alphabet = 'a';
string name = "autumn-yongs";
bool isKorean = true;
```

* A variable represents a particular piece of your computer's memory that has been set aside for you to use to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

* Basic data types
  - `int`: integers (ex. number, age, pieces, ...)
  - `double`: floating-point numbers (ex. score, point, length, ...)
  - `char`: individual characters (ex. alphabet, ASCII code, ...)
  - `string`: sequence of characters (ex. anything you want to express in string)
  - `bool`: true/false (ex. isKorean, isMarried, isEmpty, ...)
  
* Single equal sign `=` indicates assignment, not equality in the mathematical sense. Equality is indicated as double equal sign `==`.

## 3. Operators

### Relational operators

```cpp
// Greater than
bool isGreaterThan = 5 > 4;		// true
// Less than
bool isLessThan = 5 < 4; 		// false
// Greater than or equal to
bool isGreaterThanOrEqualTo = 5 >= 4;	// true
// Less than or equal to
bool isLessThanOrEqualTo = 4 <= 4;	// true
// Equal to
bool isEqualTo = 5 == 4;		// false
// Not equal to
bool isNotEqualTo = 5 != 4;		// true
```

* Relational operators `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=` compare two values on both sides of it and return boolean value, true or false.

### Logical operators

```cpp
// AND (&&)
1 < 2 && 2 < 3		// true
// OR (||)
1 < 2 || 3 < 2		// true
// NOT (!)
!(1 < 2)		// false
```

* **AND**
  - `true && true`: true
  - `true && false`: false
  - `false && true`: false
  - `false && false`: false

* **OR**
  - `true || true`: true
  - `true || false`: true
  - `false || true`: true
  - `false || false`: false

* **NOT**
  - `!true`: false
  - `!false`: true
  
### Increment/Decrement operators

```cpp
int index = 5;
// Postfix Increment
std::cout << index++ << std::endl;	// 5
std::cout << index << std::endl;	// 6
// Prefix Increment
std::cout << ++index << std::endl;	// 7
// Postfix Decrement
std::cout << index-- << std::endl;	// 7
std::cout << index << std::endl;	// 6
// Prefix Decrement
std::cout << --index << std::endl;	// 5
```

* Postfix Increment/Decrement Operator
  - Evaluate index, then increment/decrement index.
* Prefix Increment/Decrement Operator
  - Increment/Decrement index, then evaluate index.

## 4. Conditional

### If/Else statement

```cpp
int a = 4;
int b = 5;
string c;
if (a < b) {
  c = "a is less than b";
} else if (a > b) {
  c = "a is greater than b";
} else {
  c = "a is equal to b";
}
```

* `if` statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.

* You can add more conditions using `else if` statements.

* `else` statement will execute a task if any other conditions are failed to be evaluated to true.

### Switch statement

```cpp
int code = 2;
char type;
switch(code) {
  case 1:
    type = 'A';
    break;
  case 2:
    type = 'B';
    break;
  case 3:
    type = 'C';
  case 4:
    type = 'D';
  default:
    type = 'E';
    break;
}
```

* A `switch` statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple `else if` statements.

* If you skip `break;` statement in specific case, intentionally or not, program also skip the case.
  - In switch statement, **case 1** or **case 2** make `type` into **'A'** or **'B'**.
  - Even if your `code` value is 3, switch statement will skip `type = 'C';` statement and also `type = 'D';`. And finally it meets `type = 'E';` and `break;`. So, the `type` will become 'E' in the end.
  - If you want to make `type` exactly to 'C', you have to put `break;` just above the `case 4:`.

## 5. Loop

### While loop

```cpp
int count = 0;
while(count < 5) {
  std::cout << "count: " << count << std::endl;
  count++;
}
```
```text
count: 0
count: 1
count: 2
count: 3
count: 4
```

* A `while` statement executes *while* the condition is true.

* The condition between round brackets can be expressed in many ways using logical and relational operators.

* Be careful not to make the loop endless by mistake!

### For loop

```cpp
for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
  std::cout << "count: " << count << std::endl;
}
```
```text
count: 0
count: 1
count: 2
count: 3
count: 4
```

* A `for` statement also executes loop while the condition is true. But, the condition's expression is different.

* There are three separate parts to the condition separated by `;`:
  - The initialization of a counter: `int i=0`
  - The continue condition: `i<5`
  - The change in the counter: `i++`
  - Each part of the condition is optional. You don't have to fill it if you don't need.
  
## 6. Functions

```cpp
double evaluateAverage(double mathematics, double biology, double history){
  double average = (mathematics + biology + history) / 3;
  std::cout << "The average score is: " << average << std::endl;
  return average;
}

void main(){
  double mathematics, biology, history, average;
  std::cout << "Type your mathematics score: ";
  std::cin >> mathematics;
  std::cout << "Type your biology score: ";
  std::cin >> biology;
  std::cout << "Type your history score: ";
  std::cin >> history;
  average = evaluateAverage(mathematics, biology, history);
  std::cout << "I can show you the average: " << average << endl;
}
```
```text
Type your mathematics score: 80
Type your biology score: 70
Type your history score: 90
The average score is: 80
I can show you the average: 80
```

* A function is a named group of statements that do something together.
  - The function `evaluateAverage` calculates average score of subjects.

* A function has a declaration with a return type and possible parameters.
  - The sample function's return type is `double` and each subject's score is passed as parameters.
  - The `main` function's return type, `void`, signifies that this function does not have return value.
  - Except `void` functions, they must contain return statement in the body which is included in curly braces.

* Functions are called like `function_name();`
  - Function's actual input values, arguments, are covered with round brackets.
  - As function `evaluateAverage` returns value, it can be expressed as `variable = function();`
  
## 7. Classes and Objects

```cpp
class Account {
  string owner;
  string accountNum;
  int balance;
  bool isBlocked;
  
public:
  Account(string new_owner, string new_accountNum)
  : owner(new_owner), accountNum(new_accountNum), balance(0), isBlocked(false) {}
  Account(string new_owner, string new_accountNum, int new_balance)
  : owner(new_owner), accountNum(new_accountNum), balance(new_balance), isBlocked(false) {}
  Account(string new_owner, string new_accountNum, int new_balance, bool new_isBlocked)
  : owner(new_owner), accountNum(new_accountNum), balance(new_balance), isBlocked(new_isBlocked) {}
  
  int withdraw(int amounts){ ... }
  void deposit(int amounts){ ... }
  
  ~Account(){ ... }
}

void main() {
  Account myaccount("autumn-yongs", "123-1234-123456-12", 500);
  myaccount.deposit(300);
}
```

* Classes are user-defined types.
  - Class members are the data attributes(ex. owner, accountNum, balance, isBlocked) and functions(ex. withdraw, deposit) inside of a class.
  - Constructor can be defined as the name of class. It initializes objects in a particular way.
  - Destructor is called when the object gets destroyed. Destructor can be specified like `~Class_name(){}`.
  - class members can be designated as either `private` or `public` - they are `private` by default.

* Objects are instances of classes.
  - Creating a new object from a class is called instantiation.

## 8. References and Pointers

```cpp
int number = 100;
int &ref = number;

ref++;

std::cout << "number: " << number << std::endl;
std::cout << "ref: " << ref << std::endl;

double score = 4.5;
double* ptr = &score;

std::cout << "ptr: " << ptr << std::endl;
std::cout << "*ptr: " << *ptr << std::endl;

// Don't do this
// string* str_ptr;
string* str_ptr = nullptr;
```
```text
number: 101
ref: 101
ptr: 0x7ffd7caa5b54
*ptr: 4.5
```

* A reference variable is an **alias** for something else. That is, reference is another name for an already existing variable.
  - Using the `&` sign in the declaration makes an alias to specific variable.
  - Anything we do the reference also happens to the original.
  
* A pointer variable stores a memory address while normal variables store a value(such as an `int`, `double`, `char`)
  - Just like a normal variable, pointers must be declared before they can be used.
  - They are syntactically distinguished by the `*`. `int* number;` means `number` is pointer variable that can store memory address of specific variable which must be declared as `int`.
  - When we declare a pointer variable without initialization, it would be dangerous as the pointer would contains an address of **somewhere**, which is of course not a valid location. That is why we have to initialize pointer with `nullptr` if we are not planning to use it immediately.
  
* When `*` is used in a declaration, it is creating a pointer. When `*` is not used in a declaration, it is a dereference operator.

* When `&` is used in a declaration, it is creating a reference. When `&` is not used in a declaration, it returns memory address of variable.
