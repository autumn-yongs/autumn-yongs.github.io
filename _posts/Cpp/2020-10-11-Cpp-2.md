## Preface
I arranged almost the whole of Queue container. Of course, there would be more members that the container have. For now, I have organized members that would be useful to me for my future reference. However, most of you would also be content with this post.

## Queue

### What is queue?

* **Queues** are one of the data structures where elements are inserted into one end of the container and extracted from the other. And we call that **FIFO(First-In, First-Out)** opertaion.

* Imagin, literally, the queue in front of restaurant. First come is first served.

* Elements are pushed into the back of the specific container and popped from its front.

### Do you know Deque and List?

* The queue container supports the following operations:
  - `empty`
  - `size`
  - `front`
  - `back`
  - `push_back`
  - `pop_front`
  
* Of course the exact member function names are different from them, but operations are same. And the standard container class **deque** and **list** fulfill these operations. By default, if no container class is specified for a particular queue class instantiation, the standard container deque is used.

* [[C++][STL] Everything about container: Deque]({% post_url /Cpp/2020-10-11-Cpp-1 %})

### Before using queue

* Before learning queue, knowing how to use deque is required. Deque is required when initializing the queue.

```cpp
#include < ... >
#include <queue>

#include <deque>
#include <list>

using namespace std;

int main(){ ... }
```

* `#include <queue>`
  - Include `<queue>` header file to use queue container.
  
* `#include <deque>` / `#include <list>`
  - As I said before, the instantiation of queue needs deque or list which is the standard container class includes the queue's operations.
  
* `using namespace std;`
  - It's optional, but this makes programming convenient. Without this, you have to add `std::` in front of every single command related to queue.
  
### Constructor

* From now on, let's assume that each example code box contains `#include <queue>`, `#include <deque>`, `#include <list>` and `using namespace std;`.

```cpp
int main(){
  deque<int> deq = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  list<int> lst = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
  
  queue<int> queueA;
  queue<int> queueB(deq);
  queue<int, list<int>> queueC;
  queue<int, list<int>> queueD(lst);
  
  return 0;
}
```

* The basic form of declaration
  - `queue<[Data type]> [Variable name]`

* `queue<int> queueA;`
  - Create empty queue of ints with deque as default underlying container.

* `queue<int> queueB(deq);`
  - Create queue initialized to copy of deque.
  
* `queue<int, list<int>> queueC;`
  - Create empty queue of ints with list as underlying container.
  
* `queue<int, list<int>> queueD(lst);`
  - Create queue initialized to copy of list.

### Iterators

* There's no iterators in queue container. Iterating the queue is not supported.

* You can realize the iteration of the queue like below example. Note that the print function's parameter is passed by value, not a reference. You have to pop the queue one by one due to the no support for iterators.

### Capacity

```cpp
void print(queue<int> que){
  cout << "queue contains: ";
  int s = que.size();
  for(int i=0; i<s; i++){
    cout << que.front() << " ";
    que.pop();
  }
  cout << endl << endl;
}

int main(){
  deque<int> deq {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
  queue<int> que(deq);
  cout << "Declare queue" << endl;
  print(que);
  
  queue<int> empty_que;
  cout << "Declare empty queue" << endl;
  print(empty_que);
  
  cout << "The size of queues" << endl;
  cout << "que: " << que.size() << endl;
  cout << "empty_que: " << empty_que.size() << endl;
  
  cout << "Is the queue empty?" << endl;
  cout << "que: " << que.empty() << endl;
  cout << "empty_que: " << empty_que.empty() << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

---

```text
Declare queue
queue contains: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

Declare empty queue
queue contains: 

The size of queues
que: 7
empty_que: 0

Is the queue empty?
que: 0
empty_que: 1
```

---

* `size_type size()`
  - Returns the number of elements in the queue.

* `bool empty()`
  - Returns whether the queue is empty
  
### Element access

```cpp
void print(queue<int> que){
  cout << "queue contains: ";
  int s = que.size();
  for(int i=0; i<s; i++){
    cout << que.front() << " ";
    que.pop();
  }
  cout << endl;
}

int main(){
  deque<int> deq {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
  queue<int> que(deq);
  
  print(que);
  cout << "The first element is: " << que.front() << endl;
  cout << "The last element is: " << que.back() << endl << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

---

```text
queue contains: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
The first element is: 1
The last element is: 7
```

---

* As there's no function like `que.at(5)` or operator like `que[5]`, we can't see inside of the queue container without popping.

* `reference front();`
  - Returns a reference to the first element in the queue.

* `reference back();`
  - Returns a reference to the last element in the queue.

### Modifiers

### push / pop

```cpp
void print(queue<int> que){
  cout << "queue contains: ";
  int s = que.size();
  for(int i=0; i<s; i++){
    cout << que.front() << " ";
    que.pop();
  }
  cout << endl;
}

int main(){
  deque<int> deq {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
  queue<int> que(deq);
  
  print(que);
  cout << "The first element is: " << que.front() << endl;
  cout << "The last element is: " << que.back() << endl << endl;
  
  que.push(8);
  que.pop();
  
  print(que);
  cout << "The first element is: " << que.front() << endl;
  cout << "The last element is: " << que.back() << endl << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

---

```text
queue contains: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
The first element is: 1
The last element is: 7

queue contains: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
The first element is: 2
The last element is: 8
```

---

* `que.push(8);`
  - Adds a new element at the end of the queue.
  
* `que.pop();`
  - Removes the first element in the queue.
  - This method **does not return value** while popping the first value.
